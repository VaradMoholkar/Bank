## üíæ Database Schema

The application expects a MySQL database named `oops_java_project` with at least two tables:

### `user_table`
```sql
CREATE TABLE user_table (
  user_name VARCHAR(100),
  user_rollno VARCHAR(100) PRIMARY KEY,
  user_phone BIGINT,
  user_pin DOUBLE,
  user_balance INT
);
```

### `admin_table`
```sql
CREATE TABLE admin_table (
  admin_name VARCHAR(100),
  admin_rollno VARCHAR(100) PRIMARY KEY,
  admin_phone BIGINT,
  admin_pin DOUBLE
);
```

### ‚è±Ô∏è Each user also gets a custom transaction table created upon signup, e.g.:
```sql
CREATE TABLE 2001_transaction_table (
  id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
  transaction_id LONG,
  balance_before_transaction INT,
  amount_deducted INT,
  balance_after_transaction INT,
  date_time DATETIME,
  reciver_rollno VARCHAR(100)
);
```

   private static final String url = "jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/oops_java_project";
   private static final String user = "root";
   private static final String pass = "user@123";
   ```
   Update `user` and `pass` as per your MySQL setup.

4. **Build and Run**:
